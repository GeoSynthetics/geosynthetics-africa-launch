## 2026-05-05 — Fix /resources and /resources/$category rendering identical pages

**Scope:** Routing
**Summary:** `/resources` and `/resources/datasheets` (or any category slug) rendered the same page because `resources.tsx` was a layout route with a full page component but no `<Outlet />`. Fixed by extracting the landing page content into a new `resources.index.tsx` and converting `resources.tsx` into a minimal layout route that renders `<Outlet />`.
**Files touched:** `src/routes/resources.tsx`, `src/routes/resources.index.tsx` (new)
**Notes / follow-ups:** None
